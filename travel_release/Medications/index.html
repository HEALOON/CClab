        Medications

Some medications available in your home country may not be available in Abu Dhabi, while others may be strictly controlled. There are also certain medications that may be legal in your home country, but that are illegal in the UAE. The US Embassy website is a valuable resource and we encourage you to visit it to learn more about medication regulation. <br>
If a medication is strictly controlled in Abu Dhabi, the US Embassy recommends a protocol that is helpful to those traveling to the UAE: “…patients or travelers carrying prescribed prescription medications must have their prescriptions issued by licensed US doctors, attested by a notary public, and duly authenticated by both the secretary of state of one’s US state, and finally also authenticated by the Secretary of State of the US Government in Washington, DC.”<br>
For students from countries other than the US, we suggest a similar approach to that recommended by the US Embassy. It is important to note that local customs agents may confiscate medications if it appears that the amounts are greater than required for personal use or if the medications are not licensed in the UAE. If this occurs, please cooperate with the local authorities and comply with their instructions. NYUAD will assist you in obtaining new prescriptions once you arrive on campus.<br>
It is important to note that prescriptions written outside the UAE will not be filled in Abu Dhabi. You should discuss with your local health professional whether you should secure enough medication for a smooth transition and then see local medical or mental health professionals who can prescribe refills or recommend alternatives once you arrive in Abu Dhabi. If you are bringing medication with you into the UAE, please:<br>
1. Have your health professional state both the trade and generic name for your medication(s) on the prescription (in case a specific brand is not available).<br>
2. Keep the medication in the original prescription bottles and, if it is psychotropic or controlled medication, have a letter signed by your health professional supporting its use for your condition.<br>
3. Always transport medication in your carry-on luggage.<br>
4. Be sure to follow airport security guidelines, particularly if the medicine is in liquid form.<br>
5. Be aware that prescription medications mailed internationally may not be received, or may be received later than planned due to customs restrictions.<br>
6. To minimize any possible problems bringing medications, prescription or non-prescription, to NYUAD, please contact the NYUAD Health and Wellness Center at nyuad.healthcenter@nyu.edu as soon as possible.<br><br>
Minimum immunization requirements are:<br>
1. Evidence of vaccination with at least two doses of combined measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine (if not immune by documented history of having these illnesses or by blood titer).<br>
2. Evidence of vaccination with one dose of meningococcal meningitis vaccine within the past ten years.<br>
3. Additional vaccinations for you and your healthcare provider to consider for travel during your time at NYUAD:<br>
    1. Hepatitis A<br>
    2. Hepatitis B<br>
    3. Influenza<br>
    4. Polio (completion of original series and an adult booster if you are 18 or over)<br>
    5. Varicella<br>
    6. Tetanus<br><br>
Precautionary Measures<br>
Please contact the NYUAD Health and Wellness Center at nyuad.healthcenter@nyu.edu if you believe you will have difficulty securing the required vaccinations listed above.<br>
The important thing is to be in control of your own health. Here are the key points to remember for staying healthy:<br>
1. Have a complete physical examination before you go. Be aware of and prevent possible problems.<br>
2. Let NYUAD know if you are on any medications, have any allergies, or any other medical conditions that could possibly require accommodation while you are abroad. Take adequate supplies of any medications and copies of medical prescriptions with you.<br>
3. Make sure that your childhood immunizations are complete and up to date. Booster shots for tetanus are required every ten years, it may be time for another.<br>
4. Visit your dentist and have a check-up to ensure that your teeth are in good shape before you leave.<br>
5. Eat well over the break, exercise and get plenty of sleep so that you are rested and fit as you depart and your body can better fight off disease. Do not exhaust yourself with packing and preparations at the last minute. Plan ahead so that you can make your departure as stress free as possible.<br>
6. On the long flight, bring along a bottle of water and drink plenty of fluids as you travel. Avoid alcoholic beverages. They lead to dehydration. Do isometric exercises in your seat and get up to walk up and down the aisle periodically to stretch your muscles. During flu and cold season, you may want to consider a breathing mask since the recycled air in planes can easily spread contagious diseases.<br>
7. Follow all guidelines provided by your program about food and drink and personal hygiene. They are making these recommendations for a good reason.<br><br>
NYUAD will assist you if you are experiencing medical or mental health challenges. On very rare occasions, the University will make the decision that you are too ill to continue your studies. Under these circumstances, it may be necessary for family to travel to NYUAD to assist you and/or accompany you back home. In the unlikely event that family travel becomes necessary, it will be important that you have a valid passport and have provided a contact number in case of an emergency. Of course, if a student makes the decision to end his/her academic career at NYUAD or take a temporary leave of absence for whatever reason, we will assist him/her in navigating any academic and/or travel issues.<br>
NYUAD realizes that the support and supervision a student receives from family is irreplaceable. If students demonstrate the need for continued close involvement from their families, we encourage you to do your best to maintain it, using all mechanisms available to you, such as telephone, email, and video chats. Please let us know if you anticipate any barriers in maintaining this contact. NYUAD is fully committed to providing students the support they need during this important time in their lives.<br>
Should parents or guardians have any general questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us either by emailing nyuad.parents@nyu.edu, or by calling our Department of Public Safety in Abu Dhabi at +971-2-628-8777 (02-628-7777 from within the UAE) or in New York at +1-212-998-2222.
