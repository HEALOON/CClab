                <p>It absorbs the red light from the sun and turns it into yellow light in the body.It was spotted by our camera as it passed over the grassland, not visible to the eye, but visible through a mirror</p>

                It's a protein that lives in the desert steppe. The light it reflects makes the blue plants on the grassland look green. It's an organic substance that alters the path of light reflection. Recently, we have studied the energy source of this creature and found that it absorbs infrared light to obtain energy. We will make further attempts to capture and use this creature.                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Humans use the reflection of the mirror to transform the biological body into an image, but so far the camera has not been able to capture this light.
