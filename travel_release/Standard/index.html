    <h1>The Study Away Standard</h1>
   <p>This standard applies to all students who are enrolled in a course of study at a New York
    University site other than their home campus/institution.    <br>
    <br>
    Students who enroll in a program at a NYU global location assume the duties of citizenry and
    undertake an obligation to respect the culture, customs and laws of the host nation. This Study
    Away Standard affirms the expectation that students will be good citizens of their host
    communities as well as their NYU communities when they study away from their home
    campuses. Accordingly, students who engage in any of the following behaviors will be
    considered in violation of this standard:
    <br>
    • Behavior that represents a serious affront to the culture, laws, or customs of the host
    community and/or compromises the University’s interest or relationship with the host
    community;    <br>

    • Behavior involving the misuse or abuse of alcohol or drugs in violation of University
    policy and/or local law;    <br>

    • Behavior which is disruptive to the well-being of members of the University
    community, including, but not limited to, threatening or causing injury to the health or
    safety of one’s self or others.    <br>

    Failure to adhere to this Standard, as well as violations of any other applicable University
    policies or guidelines regarding student conduct, will be sufficient cause for disciplinary action.    <br>
    <br>
    Violations of the Study Away Standard may lead to penalties ranging from formal warning and
    community service to dismissal from the site and the University. In each case the appropriate
    intervention will depend upon a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the
    offense in light of University policy as well as the laws and culture of the local community; the
    impact of the behavior upon the campus and local community; the motivation underlying the
    offense; the behavioral record of the student(s) involved; and other mitigating and/or aggravating
    factors. Because the size of the site community and the availability of resources and staffing to
    address student conduct issues varies, the response to student misconduct occurring at a site
    necessarily will vary in order to effectively safeguard the interests of the site community. For this
    reason, students charged with misconduct at a site may be required to return to their home
    campuses for the resolution of student disciplinary proceedings.</p>
