    <p>NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
        TRAVEL RELEASE
        
        Acknowledgement
        I plan to participate in a New York University (the “University”) Study Away Program (the
        “Program”).1 I understand that the University is not insuring or guaranteeing, in any
        manner, my safety from personal injury or any other loss or damage, including economic,
        that may occur as a result of the Program, including any trips I may take inside or outside
        of the country in which the University’s study away site is located (the “Host Country”). I
        understand that travel presents risks to me and my personal property, involves the
        challenge of different cultural norms and expectations, and that it is my responsibility to
        understand and observe these customs. Specifically, I acknowledge that:
        Risks<br>
        1. The University is not responsible for my losses, illnesses, injuries or disabilities or
        for conditions I experience during the Program, including those that occur during
        University sponsored or supervised activities, when I am traveling independently,
        including inside and outside of the Host Country, or when I am otherwise separated
        or absent from any University-supervised activities.<br>
        2. The Program may involve risks and dangers, including dangers to my health and
        personal safety such as those posed by war, terrorism, crime, civil unrest, political
        unrest, violence, kidnapping, or illness; public health risks and risks associated
        with the possibility of different and changing foreign, political, legal, medical,
        health, social and economic conditions; different laws or standards or conduct,
        different standards of design, safety, and maintenance of buildings, public places
        and conveyances; and different local weather and environmental conditions.<br>
        3. The University cannot confirm the accuracy of information supplied by others who
        are not the official representatives of the University for the Program.<br>
        4. The University cannot eliminate all risks or guarantee my safety while I travel or
        participate in the Program.<br>
        Travel
        5. The Program involves domestic and international travel to, from, within, and
        around the Host Country and may include travel by bike, automobile, bus, van,
        train, ship, and airplane.<br>
        6. The University is not responsible for my personal effects, either in transit or at final
        destinations.<br>
        
        7. I will register with NYU Traveler (http://www.nyu.edu/life/travel-and-
        transportation/nyu-traveler.html) in advance of the Program and prior to any trips
        
        that I take while on the Program and read associated travel notices.
        <br>
        1 OR: “I, the undersigned, plan to participate in the New York University program from DATE to DATE, as described
        more fully in the [description]/[proposed curricula] attached as Exhibit A (the “Program”).
        
        {00194335.4}<br>
        8. I have read all available information about the Host Country and any other relevant
        destinations on the U.S. Department of State website (http://travel.state.gov),
        including the most recent applicable travel warnings. If I am a citizen of a country
        outside of the U.S., I also have read all available information about relevant
        destinations provided by such country. I appreciate that conditions can change
        and it is my responsibility to determine if the information on these websites is
        updated.<br>
        9. If I am a U.S. citizen, I understand that Americans are encouraged to register with
        the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy in the Host Country through the State
        Department’s travel registration Web site at www.travelregistration.state.gov. If I
        am a citizen of another country, I understand that I am encouraged to register with
        the embassy of the country of which I am a citizen.<br>

        <h1>Health</h1>
        <br>
        10.Prior to the Program, I will inform the Medical Director of the University’s Student
        Health Center of any information regarding my health, or physical or mental
        condition that may be relevant to my participation in the Program or any travel
        during the Program.<br>
        11.I have read the U.S. Centers for Disease Control health advisory information
        relating to travel abroad (http://www.cdc.gov/travel), and any additional information
        available from the World Health Organization website (http://www.who.int/). I am
        responsible for complying with any immunizations or precautions recommended or
        required by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and/or the World Health
        Organization.<br>
        12.I am aware that I can obtain medical advice (country specific presentation by
        nursing staff), immunizations, and prescriptions from the NYU Student Health
        Center or other appropriate medical professionals.
        Policies and Laws<br>
        13.I am bound by and will comply with the University’s policies and procedures during
        the Program.<br>
        14.I will become informed of, and will abide by, the laws and standards for the Host
        Country and each other country or territory, including laws of the United States that
        have extraterritorial application, to or through which I will travel during the Program,
        including with respect to any research or non-University sponsored activities.<br>
        15.If I plan to travel to any country (e.g., Syria, Iran, Cuba, etc.) subject to economic
        or trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)
        of the US Department of the Treasury or to interact with any individual or company
        on the Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN”) list maintained by OFAC (see
        treasury.gov for a complete list of countries subject to sanctions and for the SDN
        list), I have consulted with the Office of General Counsel and obtained all required
        licenses or confirmation from the Office of General Counsel that a license is not
        required and will comply with any applicable OFAC regulations or sanctions.
        
        {00194335.4}<br>
        Changes to the Program<br>
        16.I understand that the policies, requirements, course offerings, schedules, activities,
        mode of instruction, tuition, fees, and calendar of the Program are subject to
        change without notice at any time at the sole discretion of University’s
        administration. Such changes may be of any nature, including, but not limited to,
        the elimination of the Program, classes, or activities; the relocation or modification
        of the content of any of the foregoing; and the modification or cancellation of
        scheduled classes or other activities, provided that any such changes shall be
        made consistent with federal, state, and other applicable regulations or standards
        concerning accreditation and other regulated University and Program
        requirements.<br>
        17.I will obtain prior written permission from the appropriate University representative
        (e.g., the staff or faculty member who is leading the Program or such other person
        designated by the University as the Program leader) if I choose to leave the
        Program prior to its scheduled conclusion or not to return to the final destination at
        the conclusion of the Program. I will be responsible for any additional expenses or
        issues that result from if I leave the Program early or do not to return to the final
        destination with the group. The University is not responsible for my losses,
        illnesses, injuries or disabilities or for conditions I experience if I leave the Program
        prior to its scheduled conclusion or do not return to the final destination at the
        conclusion of the Program.        <br>

        I have made my own investigation of the risks described above, understand these risks
        and assume them knowingly and willingly. With full knowledge of the risks and liabilities
        associated with the Program, I have made the independent judgment to participate
        voluntarily in the Program.        <br>

        Release and Waiver of Liability and Covenant not to Sue        <br>

        I agree the University is not responsible if anything happens to me or to my
        property in connection with my participation in the Program, including any trips I
        may take inside or outside of the Host Country. Knowing the risks and dangers
        associated with the Program and in consideration for being permitted to participate
        in the Program, I also agree, to the maximum extent permitted by law:
        <br>
        1. to release and discharge the University from any liability or responsibility for
        any personal or bodily injury (including death), economic injury, and for any
        damage to or loss of property, however caused, that I suffer as a result of or
        in connection with my participation in the Program or any related or
        independent travel, including, but not limited to, any injury, loss or damage
        resulting from or arising out of the negligent acts or omissions of members
        of the faculty or administration or other employees, agents, or servants of
        the University; and
        
        <br>
        2. not to raise any claim or institute any legal action or proceeding against the
        University that I have ever had, now have, or may have in the future or which
        my heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns may have, or claim to have,
        for any cause of action that may result from or arise out of my participation
        in the Program or any travel related to the Program, including, but not limited
        to, any cause of action that may result from or arise out of the negligent acts
        or omissions of members of the faculty or administration or other
        employees, agents or servants of the University, and any cause of action that
        might otherwise result from or arise out of any changes to the policies,
        requirements, course offerings, schedules, activities, mode of instruction,
        tuition, fees, or calendar of the Program.
